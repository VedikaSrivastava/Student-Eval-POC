Effective Assessment Feedback Guide
Making feedback on assignments effective: style guide for tutors

PURPOSE

Providing feedback on assignments is one of the most time-consuming things tutors do. 
Extensive research shows that it can also be one of the most influential things tutors do to improve student learning. 
However, this relies on the students engaging with the feedback. 
Student survey outcomes are dependent on all students understanding the validity, reliability, and consistency of the approach. 
It is known that successful engagement leads to higher outcomes and better attainment for students. 
This document aims to provide guidance so that time spent marking has an impact.
 
Feedback needs to be timely to have an impact, and be seen to be fair and consistent.
The timeliness, quality, and efficiency of assessment and feedback is a key indicator of students’ educational experience 
    and of their relationship with the University. 

All lecturers (including new, part-time, and associate) may need to be reminded that the ‘timeliness’ of assessment feedback 
    is a priority in the National Student Survey and related surveys, and remains a vulnerable area for many courses. 

Even when tutors adhere to the 20 working day rule for turnaround, students have often ‘moved on’ by the time they receive their feedback. 
Ways to bridge the gap between submission and the publication of feedback might include:
•	providing model answers immediately after assignments are submitted
•	summarising good and bad points from the first few assignments read and discussing these in the next lecture
•	asking students to read and comment on each others’ assignments

NB: Take special care not to give unfair advantage to students who are submitting late for some reason.


Practices for return of grades and feedback may vary between marking teams for sound pedagogical reasons;
    but students have a right to expect consistency at modular level.
 
Too strong an emphasis on grades can reduce the value of feedback

Sometimes course teams withhold or delay grades in order to influence students to engage more actively with their feedback. 
When such a method is used, it must be clearly explained at the start of the module.

Getting the balance right is critical

Colleagues who are new to using Turnitin®, or to electronic marking in general, 
    will find some useful guidance via the link https://lttu.uk/support/Turnitin/Guide/.
Experienced users of Turnitin usually build a personal ‘library’ of generic annotations that they can use repeatedly; 
    this can certainly help to speed up the marking process. 
    
It makes good sense to store and share widely applicable, frequently repeated notes 
    – for example on construction of argument, handling of sources, aspects of technical writing skills, and referencing. 
    It might be useful to share these comment banks with students in advance so that they use them to evaluate their own work before submission.
However, it can also send the wrong signal to students if the bulk of their feedback takes the form of generic ‘off the peg’ comments. 
There also needs to be some personally-directed annotation, which engages with the unique content of each student’s assignment. 
A balanced combination of the two can give a good impression – organisation and rigour, plus considered attention to the individual.

Markers should avoid repeating the same critical annotation multiple times, as it will clutter up the assignment and lose its impact. 
If a mistake is made repeatedly in a given assignment, the tutor might want to state this openly 
    – eg ‘I won’t mark up every instance of this error, but it is a major issue in your work, which we should discuss’. 
A lot of feedback concentrates on grammatical or technical errors rather than the content. 
Feedback should be primarily in relation to the validated Learning Outcomes; 
    markers should bear this mind when commenting on grammatical accuracy and written style.
 
 
If it is the practice of a course team for second-markers to add some further annotation, 
    these notes should be colour-coded or marked with initials to identify the second-marker. 

Alternatively, a course team may decide that second-markers do not annotate the scripts, but instead write a summative comment.

Feedback should enable future improvement
Feedback to students at the University of Worcester should always be supportive and focused on future improvement. 
This applies at all levels of ability and at every level of study. 
Feedback which refers only to subject matter that will not be studied again tends to be ignored, as students are too busy working on the next topic. 
For this reason, assessment that has been designed as a linked sequence, 
    with aspects of one assignment contributing to the way students tackle the next, gives feedback greater impact.

Marking teams may or may not choose to use a grading form or ‘rubric’ within Turnitin, 
    in order to structure the summative feedback; the University has no rules on this (although Schools or Departments might).
However, all markers within a given module team must use the same approach, 
    since discrepancies between markers’ methods will undermine students’ confidence in the process.


 
As with annotation in the script, the tone of the marker’s overview is important. 
Aim for a reasonable balance between professional rigour and informality. 
The use of irony and humour are to be avoided; there are too many ways this can go wrong, despite good intentions. 
Sometimes new colleagues, especially those joining the University from another part of the HE sector, may need guidance on tone. 
Practices vary considerably, and some colleagues might be used to making quite sharp judgements in their feedback 
    which students may well find demoralising or even hurtful. 
Support and mentoring for new colleagues, and the sampling of their feedback by a ‘critical friend’ will help to avoid this potential problem. 
New markers also need to see assignments of varying standards so that feedback and marks can be calibrated. 
Retaining a selection of assignments at varying grade boundaries can support students and new markers.

In assessments that are based on discursive writing, technical features such as grammar, syntax, and punctuation 
    frequently attract critical comment from markers. 
    
If correct writing is relevant and important to the assignment, the tutor should observe similar good practice in their feedback. 
Avoid the impression of ‘do as I say, not as do’ with ungrammatical writing. 
Students are frequently told they need to proof-read their work more carefully; equally, markers need to proof-read their feedback too.

Students should be aware of academic standards, and be able to take ownership of their learning; 
this is not done by providing a brief set of criteria, but by learning to make judgements in a similar way to experienced markers
The notion of collaboration and / or student co-construction needs careful consideration to improve engagement. 
This significantly shifts the balance of feedback / assessment power towards autonomy and self-responsibility among the student body. 
It can be achieved in a number of ways, such as:

•	including course representatives in discussions about consistency and best practice
•	asking students to self-assess the assignment before they submit it, with qualitative critical comments and an estimated grade
•	peer assessment and feedback at formative assessment stages
•	a sample marking exercise in a teaching session

Feedback needs to be engaging and accessible to all
Assignments that involve two stages of assessment (sometimes called formative and summative) 
    allow students to engage with their work and to make improvements. 

Both stages could employ innovative strategies for engaging the student in the feedback, including:
•	recording oral commentaries and emailing the feedback to the student; this can be done easily using digital audio recorders, 
        or alternatively use the embedded audio feedback tool in Turnitin
•	word-processing feedback for all students and making the entire text accessible to the group
•	requiring students to be specific about what aspects they would like feedback on, when they submit their work
•	peer assessment
 
Finally, have a module / course agreement on what  feedback looks like, to ensure consistency
It is good practice for teams to review their principles and develop a team / module approach to assignment feedback. 
An annual standardisation meeting or workshop, to discuss a sample of recent marking, 
    can be an effective way to set consistent standards in the team. 
    
Including course representatives may also help with the management of student expectations.
